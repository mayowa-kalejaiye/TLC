## 🔧 Making Changes

All components are in `components/` folder:

## ⚠️ Current Limitations (Will Fix Soon)

- Logo and images show as broken (need actual image files)
- "LIVE NOW" indicator always shows (need YouTube API to detect live status)
- Newsletter form doesn't actually send emails yet (need email API)
- No inner pages yet (About, Sermons, etc.)
- No payment integration yet
